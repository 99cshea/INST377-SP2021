This will be a little tricky, and needs to be done in order, or you will not be able to submit your labs for this class. If you do not submit your labs, you can't get credit for them - but more importantly, you won't be able to practice your debugging before your group project.

Most of programming is debugging and very carefully following instructions. 

Let's do this together.

- Your node installation must be above version 13.0
    - To check your version of Node.js, open Terminal (or another CLI), and type the command node -v. Press Enter. 

- Sign up for a github.com account
- Sign up for a heroku.com account

- Find and install Github Desktop if you have not already done so
- Create a new repository called "your-name-inst377" on your github Desktop
- Push it to your github account

- In your Heroku account, create a new app called "your-name-inst377"
- Authorize your Github account to be your primary Deployment method
- Connect your new Github repository to your new app in Heroku so that it can "deploy" automatically to the internet.

- Are there easier ways to do this at the start?
--- Yeah, but they make it _way_ harder later on.

- Great, now you're ready to start your lab.


LAB PROBLEMS:

- This lab comes from this page, read thoroughly to ensure you have a solid understanding of the Anatomy of an HTML document before beginning: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics

- From Github Desktop, open Visual Studio Code and create an HTML page.

Your page must have:
- An appropriate head and body tag
- An H1 header with your name in it
- A paragraph with 50 words of lorem ipsum in it
- An unordered list with three elements in it, containing fruit or vegetable names from a list.
- A PNG image of something cute, formatted so that it is not warped
- A correctly-formatted link to the UMD homepage

Once you have completed all the steps, push your changes through Github Desktop.
